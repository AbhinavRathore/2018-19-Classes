## MNIST : Hand written digit recognition 

- To try MNIST hand-written digit recognition in your web browser click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CC-MNNIT/2018-19-Classes/blob/master/MachineLearning/2018_08_27_Logical-Rhythm-3/MNIST.ipynb)
- Feel free to ask anything about the notebook. I have written it myself.
- The implementation is in keras (check [keras.io](keras.io) for detailed documentation)


[Here](https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120-india) is a course that [my](https://github.com/packetChor) friends have suggested, it is bit implementation oriented, instead of being algorithm oriented.


> Will probably add more resources for first three classes. Please check [this folder](https://github.com/CC-MNNIT/2018-19-Classes/tree/master/MachineLearning) at regular intervals.
