## Instructions for students :

- Always keep a copy of this repository on your main machine.
- **Please** use the following git command for cloning

      git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/CC-MNNIT/classes.git
- Refrain from making changes directly to the cloned local copy. If you want to experiment, create a copy of the part of local repository which you want to experiment with, somewhere else on your machine and probe your changes there. This way you will always have a local copy of the original source that we provided you with.

- If all goes wrong, use the following commands

      git fetch origin
      git reset --hard origin/master
- To update your existing local clone

      git pull
